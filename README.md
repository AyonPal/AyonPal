### Hi there 👋

I love to try new technology. Recently started contributing to open source on Github. 

Worked as *Freelancer* for **4+ years**.

Also I want to work on **Game Development**, as I spent a good amount of time playing games (and still play 😂) but it's still a dream for me.

Thanks to [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) 🙏 to help me start on open source.
### Top Projects I worked on
 - [Q1](https://qonebs.qa) All in One billing and Payment Solution Application (ongoing)
 - Kiosk - (Qatar based Vending Machine Software) as Backend Dev and Architect
 - [RiniRefrigeration](https://services.rinirefrigeration.in/customer/) - A Local service business site
